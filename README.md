# 🦷 Segmentation of Dental Restorations in Panoramic Radiographs

In this project, I developed a model and a desktop application to detect and classify dental restorations in panoramic radiograph images. I utilized advanced object detection algorithms like Detectron2, YOLOv8, and YOLOv7 for labeling datasets and working on object detection.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - 📸 Collected panoramic radiograph images.
   - 🖊️ Manually labeled the images for dental restorations.
   - ✅ The labeling process was carefully done to ensure a high-accuracy dataset for model training.

2. **Model Training:**
   - 🧠 Trained models using object detection algorithms such as Detectron2, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8.
   - 🎯 Optimized the models to recognize and classify different types of dental restorations.

3. **Desktop Application:**
   - 💻 Developed a user-friendly desktop application.
   - 🔍 The application uses the trained models to automatically detect and classify dental restorations in panoramic radiograph images.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Detectron2:** A high-performance library for object detection and segmentation developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR).
- **YOLOv7 & YOLOv8:** Fast and lightweight deep learning models optimized for object detection.
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for application development and model training.
- **PyTorch:** An open-source library used for training deep learning models.
